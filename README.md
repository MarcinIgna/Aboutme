# Hi there, I'm Marcin! ðŸ‘‹

Originally from Poland, I have a background in engineering and management, and previously worked as a business development manager. I've recently made a career change to become a Python backend developer with a focus on machine learning.

I'm passionate about leveraging the power of machine learning to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions. With my technical skills and experience in business management, I'm able to bring a unique perspective to the development process.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about new technologies, exploring the outdoors,bouldering , and spending time with my friends.

Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and LinkedIn to collaborate on exciting projects or just say hello! ðŸ˜„
